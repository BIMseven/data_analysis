SUBJECT SAYS THE BRIGHTNESS WAS PERFECT
obstacles were different
"If I knew ahead of time was the objects all looked like it would have been easier"

Analysis:

Unlike the performance of test 1, subject had an evenly difficult time navigating the course. Subject had stayed on course better for the second course, however spent much more time completing the course and still ended up spending more time off course. 

Subject required bright arrows with a dark back drop in order to detect the proper path in the first place.
