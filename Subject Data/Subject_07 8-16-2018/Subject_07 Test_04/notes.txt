Subject_07 Test_04

Found bugs with turning off the eyes, leading to the course to dissapear and be replaced with red planes while preserving a few obstacles. 
Also found that deactivating both eyes worked, however individual eyes were unable to be modified. Subject mentioned brief moments
in which they were able to see only out of the left eye. 

TODO:
Must look for bugs with the EyeActivator, and whether or not our clipping plane modifications are being overwritten 
with any built in software of the VIVE or STEAMVR.
